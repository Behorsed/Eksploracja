# Eksploracja
Project

To run the project, you need python, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. I used the newest versions available on 24.03.19. 
You also need to download the dataset, Global Terrorism Database, from https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd, and place it in the directory above your repository. I used the globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv file. 

There's a html file with the preview of the notebook in the repository as well, but it doesn't contain the maps since they're interactive.
